\documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
\usepackage{graphicx}
% Some/most Computer Society conferences require the compsoc mode option,
% but others may want the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
 \ref{subsec1} We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map raw pixels from a sin-gle front-facing camera directly to steering commands. This end-to-end approachproved surprisingly powerful. With minimum training data from humans the sys-tem learns to drive in traffic on local roads with or without lane markings and onhighways. It also operates in areas with unclear visual guidance such as in parkinglots and on unpaved roads.The system automatically learns internal representations of the necessary process-ing steps such as detecting useful road features with only the human steering angleas the training signal. We never explicitly trained it to detect, for example, the out-line of roads.Compared to explicit decomposition of the problem, such as lane marking detec-tion, path planning, and control, our end-to-end system optimizes all processingsteps  simultaneously.   We  argue  that  this  will  eventually  lead  to  better  perfor-mance and smaller systems.  Better performance will result because the internalcomponents self-optimize to maximize overall system performance, instead of op-timizing human-selected intermediate criteria, e. g., lane detection.  Such criteriaunderstandably are selected for ease of human interpretation which doesn’t auto-matically guarantee maximum system performance.  Smaller networks are possi-ble because the system learns to solve the problem with the minimal number ofprocessing steps.We  used  an  NVIDIA  DevBox  and  Torch  7  for  training  and  an  NVIDIADRIVETMPX  self-driving  car  computer  also  running  Torch  7  for  determiningwhere to drive. The system operates at 30 frames per second (FPS).

\section{Introduction}
	have revolutionized pattern recognition \cite{Sh:1} .  Prior to the widespread adoption of CNNs,most pattern recognition tasks were performed using an initial stage of hand-crafted feature extrac-tion followed by a classifier.  The breakthrough of CNNs is that features are learned automaticallyfrom training examples.  The CNN approach is especially powerful in image recognition tasks be-cause the convolution operation captures the 2D nature of images.  Also, by using the convolutionkernels to scan an entire image, relatively few parameters need to be learned compared to the totalnumber of operations.While CNNs with learned features have been in commercial use for over twenty years section,  theiradoption has exploded in the last few years because of two recent developments. First, large, labeleddata sets such as the Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) [4] have become avail-able for training and validation.  Second, CNN learning algorithms have been implemented on themassively parallel graphics processing units (GPUs) which tremendously accelerate learning andinference.In this paper,  we describe a CNN that goes beyond pattern recognition.   It learns the entire pro-cessing pipeline needed to steer an automobile.  The groundwork for this project was done over 10years ago in a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) seedling project known asDARPA Autonomous Vehicle (DAVE) [5] in which a sub-scale radio control (RC) car drove througha junk-filled alley way. DAVE was trained on hours of human driving in similar, but not identical en-vironments. The training data included video from two cameras coupled with left and right steeringcommands from a human operator.In many ways, DAVE-2 was inspired by the pioneering work of Pomerleau \cite{Sh:2} who in 1989 built theAutonomous Land Vehicle in a Neural Network (ALVINN) system. It demonstrated that an end-to-end trained neural network can indeed steer a car on public roads. Our work differs in that 25 years ofadvances let us apply far more data and computational power to the task. In addition, our experiencewith CNNs lets us make use of this powerful technology. (ALVINN used a fully-connected networkwhich is tiny by today’s standard.)While  DAVE  demonstrated  the  potential  of  end-to-end  learning,  and  indeed  was  used  to  justifystarting the DARPA Learning Applied to Ground Robots (LAGR) program [7], DAVE’s performancewas not sufficiently reliable to provide a full alternative to more modular approaches to off-roaddriving. DAVE’s mean distance between crashes was about 20 meters in complex environments.Nine months ago, a new effort was started at NVIDIA that sought to build on DAVE and create arobust system for driving on public roads. The primary motivation for this work is to avoid the needto recognize specific human-designated features, such as lane markings, guard rails, or other cars,and to avoid having to create a collection of “if, then, else” rules, based on observation of thesefeatures. This paper describes preliminary results of this new effort.
	\subsection{Data Selection}
	\label{subsec1}	
	The  first  step  to  training  a  neural  network  is  selecting  the  frames  to  use.   Our  collected  data  islabeled with road type,  weather condition,  and the driver’s activity (staying in a lane,  switchinglanes, turning, and so forth).  To train a CNN to do lane following we only select data where thedriver was staying in a lane and discard the rest.  We then sample that video at 10 FPS. A highersampling rate would result in including images that are highly similar and thus not provide muchuseful information.
	Types of Neural Networks:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Feed Forward Neural Network
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Single Layered Perceptron
			\item Multi Layered Perceptron
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Convolutional Neural Network
		\item Recurrent Neural Network
		\item Generative Adversarial Network
	\end{itemize}
	Steering angle is given by 
	\begin{equation}
	SA=	\arctan L/R + \delta - \alpha
	\end{equation}
